# Config

Mixing are configurable and can be tuned.
If you want to adjust these settings,
you should provide a config property to useMixing:

```js
const { x } = useMixing({
  from: { x: 0 },
  config: { rate: 1 },
})

useEffect(() => {
  x.start({ config: { volume: 0 } })
  x.start({ config: { pitch: 20 } })
}, [])
```

And we've added the following properties rate, pitch, volume, voice & lang.

```
